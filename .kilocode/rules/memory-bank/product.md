# PorTTY Product Vision

## Why PorTTY Exists

PorTTY was created to solve a fundamental problem in remote system administration and development: the need for quick, reliable terminal access from any device without requiring SSH client installation or configuration. It bridges the gap between traditional terminal access methods and modern web-based workflows.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Client Dependency**: Eliminates the need for SSH clients on user devices
2. **Cross-Platform Access**: Provides consistent terminal experience across all operating systems
3. **Session Persistence**: Maintains terminal state between connections using tmux
4. **Network Resilience**: Handles connection interruptions gracefully with auto-reconnection
5. **Deployment Simplicity**: Single binary deployment without complex dependencies
6. **Firewall Restrictions**: Works through standard HTTP/HTTPS ports where SSH might be blocked

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to PorTTY URL in any modern web browser
2. Terminal interface loads instantly with no plugins or extensions required
3. Connection establishes automatically to the server's tmux session
4. User interacts with terminal as if using a native terminal application
5. Session persists even if browser closes or network disconnects
6. Reconnecting resumes exactly where the user left off

### Key Behaviors
- **Instant Access**: No login screens or configuration - direct terminal access
- **Responsive Interface**: Terminal automatically adjusts to browser window size
- **Native Feel**: Full keyboard support, copy/paste functionality, and terminal shortcuts
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear connection status indicators and error messages
- **Performance**: Low-latency interaction comparable to native terminals

## User Experience Goals

1. **Zero Friction**: From URL to terminal in under 2 seconds
2. **Intuitive**: Works exactly as users expect a terminal to work
3. **Reliable**: Maintains connection stability and handles failures gracefully
4. **Performant**: Feels as responsive as a local terminal
5. **Accessible**: Works on any device with a modern web browser
6. **Secure**: Designed to work behind authentication proxies and HTTPS

## Target Users

- **System Administrators**: Quick server access from any location
- **Developers**: Remote development environment access
- **DevOps Teams**: Emergency access to production systems
- **Educational Institutions**: Providing terminal access to students
- **Restricted Environments**: Users in networks where SSH is blocked

## Success Metrics

- Time from URL to usable terminal < 2 seconds
- Connection reliability > 99.9% uptime
- Latency overhead < 50ms compared to native SSH
- Browser compatibility > 95% of modern browsers
- Zero client-side installation required
