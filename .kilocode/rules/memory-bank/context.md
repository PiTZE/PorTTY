# PorTTY Current Context

## Current State
- Project version: v0.2 (Complete architectural refactoring with PWA capabilities)
- Core functionality implemented and working with enhanced architecture
- Single binary deployment achieved with interface-based design
- Browser-based terminal fully functional with PWA capabilities
- tmux integration for session persistence complete and verified
- Progressive Web App features fully implemented

## Recent Work
- **v0.2 Complete Backend Refactoring**:
  - Comprehensive 5-phase architectural transformation from v0.1 to v0.2
  - Interface-based architecture with dependency injection for better testability
  - Centralized configuration management (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - Structured logging system with component-specific loggers (`internal/logger/logger.go`)
  - Proper context propagation and graceful shutdown coordination
  - Comprehensive interface definitions (`internal/interfaces/interfaces.go`)
  - Factory patterns for testable component creation

- **PWA Loading Spinner Fix (Latest)**:
  - Fixed invalid SVG screenshot in manifest.json containing `<txt>` elements instead of `<text>` elements
  - Removed duplicate PWA installation handlers causing user gesture conflicts
  - Corrected base64-encoded SVG screenshot for proper PWA installation preview
  - Eliminated loading spinner issue in PWA installation dialog

- **Asset Reorganization (Latest)**:
  - Created organized directory structure: `css/`, `js/`, and `icons/` subdirectories
  - Moved `terminal.css` to `cmd/portty/assets/css/terminal.css`
  - Moved `terminal.js` and `sw.js` to `cmd/portty/assets/js/` directory
  - Created theme-based icon system with `light-theme-icon.svg` and `dark-theme-icon.svg`
  - Updated all file references in `index.html`, `sw.js`, and `manifest.json`
  - Cleaned up temporary and duplicate files for better maintainability

- **Style Guide Compliance**:
  - Updated version from v0.1 to v0.2 across all files
  - Added missing Go doc comments for exported functions
  - Extracted hardcoded values to named constants
  - Verified minimal commenting philosophy compliance
  - Standardized error message formats with proper context

- **Architecture Verification**:
  - Confirmed tmux session persistence behavior remains intact after refactoring
  - Individual WebSocket connection closures preserve tmux sessions
  - Sessions only terminate during server shutdown or explicit stop commands
  - New connections successfully attach to existing sessions

- **PWA Implementation** (Previous work):
  - Complete PWA transformation with manifest.json and service worker
  - Enhanced WebSocket connection management with keep-alive mechanisms
  - Connection status indicators and info buttons
  - PWA installation prompts and native app experience
  - Offline caching strategy for app shell

- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Eliminated code duplications between CSS and JavaScript
  - Centralized configuration using CSS custom properties
  - Consolidated connection status management into single class
  - Standardized font to JetBrains Mono across entire application
  - Removed redundant files and references
  - Improved code maintainability and DRY principles

## Active Development Focus
- Project is in stable v0.2 release state with production-ready architecture
- Complete backend refactoring completed with interface-based design
- Enhanced testability and maintainability through dependency injection
- Ready for production use with modern Go architecture patterns

## Known Issues
- WebSocket connections are not encrypted by default
- No built-in authentication mechanism
- Requires reverse proxy for production security

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)
- Consider adding built-in HTTPS/WSS support
- Explore authentication options
- Add comprehensive unit tests leveraging new interface-based architecture
- Monitor PWA installation and usage patterns
- Plan for v0.3 features based on user feedback
