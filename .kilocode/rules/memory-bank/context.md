# PorTTY Current Context

## Current State
- Project version: v0.2+ (Complete architectural refactoring with PWA capabilities and shell mode support)
- Core functionality implemented and working with enhanced architecture
- Single binary deployment achieved with interface-based design
- Browser-based terminal fully functional with PWA capabilities
- Dual shell mode support: default shell (primary) and tmux mode (optional)
- Progressive Web App features fully implemented
- Nerd Font support for proper icon rendering
- Production-ready with comprehensive frontend enhancements

## Recent Work
- **Shell Mode Implementation (Latest)**:
  - **Default Shell Mode**: Uses user's default shell directly (zsh, bash, etc.) as primary mode
  - **Optional tmux Mode**: Available via `--tmux` flag for session persistence
  - **Smart Shell Detection**: Fixed NixOS compatibility by prioritizing `/etc/passwd` over environment variables
  - **Command Line Interface**: Added `--tmux` flag and updated help documentation
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with various shell configurations and distributions


- **Enhanced Frontend Architecture**:
  - Comprehensive xterm.js addon integration with 8 addons loaded
  - Advanced terminal features: WebGL acceleration, search, clipboard, web links, Unicode11 support
  - Smart renderer selection (WebGL for desktop, Canvas for mobile devices)
  - Mobile device detection with multiple validation methods
  - Performance-optimized terminal initialization with proper addon loading order
  - WebGL context loss handling for production stability
  - Font size management with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+/-, Ctrl+0)
  - Advanced search functionality with overlay UI and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F)

- **Terminal Resizing Performance Fix**:
  - Fixed critical terminal resizing bug that prevented dynamic viewport adaptation
  - Implemented WebGL addon with proper context loss handling for hardware acceleration
  - Resolved resize event loop caused by multiple competing ResizeObserver instances
  - Fixed initialization timing by loading FitAddon before terminal opening
  - Removed CSS layout conflicts by eliminating `!important` declarations in `.xterm-screen`
  - Eliminated debouncing and cooldown periods for immediate resize response
  - Cleaned up all debug logging code for production-ready performance
  - Terminal now handles very small viewport sizes gracefully (like VS Code/Alacritty)
  - Achieved instant resize response with 5px threshold optimization

- **Localhost Connection Status Fix**:
  - Implemented automatic localhost detection to hide connection status indicators
  - Added `isRunningOnLocalhost()` utility function detecting localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1
  - Enhanced ConnectionStatusManager class with localhost-aware behavior
  - Connection status indicator, text, and info button now hidden on localhost for cleaner development experience
  - Production functionality remains fully intact on remote servers
  - Zero configuration required - automatic hostname-based detection

- **v0.2 Complete Backend Refactoring**:
  - Comprehensive 5-phase architectural transformation from v0.1 to v0.2
  - Interface-based architecture with dependency injection for better testability
  - Centralized configuration management (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - Structured logging system with component-specific loggers (`internal/logger/logger.go`)
  - Proper context propagation and graceful shutdown coordination
  - Comprehensive interface definitions (`internal/interfaces/interfaces.go`)
  - Factory patterns for testable component creation

- **Asset Reorganization**:
  - Created organized directory structure: `css/`, `js/`, and `icons/` subdirectories
  - Moved `terminal.css` to `cmd/portty/assets/css/terminal.css`
  - Moved `terminal.js` and `sw.js` to `cmd/portty/assets/js/` directory
  - Created theme-based icon system with `light-theme-icon.svg` and `dark-theme-icon.svg`
  - Updated all file references in `index.html`, `sw.js`, and `manifest.json`
  - Cleaned up temporary and duplicate files for better maintainability

- **PWA Implementation**:
  - Complete PWA transformation with manifest.json and service worker
  - Enhanced WebSocket connection management with keep-alive mechanisms
  - Connection status indicators and info buttons
  - PWA installation prompts and native app experience
  - Offline caching strategy for app shell

- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Eliminated code duplications between CSS and JavaScript
  - Centralized configuration using CSS custom properties
  - Consolidated connection status management into single class
  - Standardized font to JetBrains Mono across entire application
  - Removed redundant files and references
  - Improved code maintainability and DRY principles

## Active Development Focus
- Project is in stable v0.2+ release state with production-ready architecture
- Complete backend refactoring completed with interface-based design
- Enhanced testability and maintainability through dependency injection
- Advanced frontend features with comprehensive xterm.js addon integration
- Dual shell mode support (default shell + optional tmux mode)
- Nerd Font support for proper icon rendering
- Ready for production use with modern Go architecture patterns

## Known Issues
- WebSocket connections are not encrypted by default
- No built-in authentication mechanism
- Requires reverse proxy for production security

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)
- Consider adding built-in HTTPS/WSS support
- Explore authentication options
- Add comprehensive unit tests leveraging new interface-based architecture
- Monitor PWA installation and usage patterns
- Plan for v0.3 features based on user feedback

## Recent Achievements
- **Shell Mode Flexibility**: Successfully implemented dual shell mode support with default shell as primary option
- **Nerd Font Integration**: Added comprehensive Nerd Font support for proper shell prompt icon rendering
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved scrollback with hidden scrollbars and robust terminal resizing
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fixed shell detection issues on NixOS and other distributions
- **Performance Optimizations**: Enhanced terminal initialization with better error handling and fallback mechanisms
