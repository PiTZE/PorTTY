## Recent Work (v0.2 Release Completion)
- **Build System Overhaul (Latest)**:
  - **Issue Identified**: Build script only created one binary and exited, no tar files generated for default builds
  - **Root Cause**: `set -e` combined with arithmetic operations `((build_count++))` causing script exit on first increment
  - **Solution Applied**: Changed arithmetic operations to `build_count=$((build_count + 1))` format
  - **Default Build Fix**: Removed version check preventing tar creation in dev mode - now all builds create tar files
  - **Directory Organization**: All outputs organized in `build/bin/` (binaries) and `build/release/` (compressed archives)
  - **Git Integration**: Added `/build/` directory to .gitignore to exclude build artifacts from version control
  - **Tag Update**: Updated v0.2 tag to include build system fixes with comprehensive release message
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Successfully builds 13 platform combinations with static linking for universal compatibility
  - **Testing Verified**: All build modes (`./build.sh`, `./build.sh all`, `./build.sh release`) working correctly

- **Critical Installation Fix (Previous)**:
  - **Issue Identified**: Download failures with curl exit code 3 (URL malformed) due to temporary file creation problems
  - **Root Cause**: `mktemp` attempting to create files in `/usr/local/bin/` without proper permissions
  - **Solution Applied**: Changed temporary file creation to use system temp directory with `-t` flag
  - **Fix Verified**: Complete installation process now works correctly with successful download, extraction, and service startup
  - **Testing Confirmed**: Full installation cycle tested successfully with v0.2 release artifacts

- **Professional CLI Tools & Installation System**:
  - **Complete Feature Parity**: Interactive and command-line modes offer identical functionality (43/43 tests passing)
  - **Enhanced Install.sh Script**: Professional CLI with colored output, comprehensive error handling, and recovery suggestions
  - **Enhanced PorTTY Binary CLI**: Professional argument parsing with both short and long flag support
  - **Production-Ready Quality**: Enterprise-grade installer suitable for professional deployment
  - **Smart Privilege Handling**: Interactive mode entry without requiring root upfront
  - **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Port range checking, interface validation, directory verification
  - **Robust Download System**: Support for compressed GitHub release archives with proper extraction
  - **Code Style Compliance**: Applied minimal commenting philosophy with self-documenting code

- **v0.2 GitHub Release**:
  - **Release Published**: Successfully created and published on GitHub with all artifacts
  - **Build Artifacts**: Generated `portty-v0.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz` (2.7 MB) and SHA256 checksum
  - **Version Detection**: GitHub API correctly returns v0.2 as latest version
  - **Download Verification**: All release files are publicly accessible and functional
  - **Installation Testing**: Verified install.sh works correctly with v0.2 release after fixing temporary file issue

- **Shell Mode Implementation**:
  - **Default Shell Mode**: Uses user's default shell directly (zsh, bash, etc.) as primary mode
  - **Optional tmux Mode**: Available via `--tmux` flag for session persistence
  - **Smart Shell Detection**: Fixed NixOS compatibility by prioritizing `/etc/passwd` over environment variables
  - **Command Line Interface**: Added `--tmux` flag and updated help documentation
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Works with various shell configurations and distributions

- **Enhanced Frontend Architecture**:
  - Comprehensive xterm.js addon integration with 8 addons loaded
  - Advanced terminal features: WebGL acceleration, search, clipboard, web links, Unicode11 support
  - Smart renderer selection (WebGL for desktop, Canvas for mobile devices)
  - Mobile device detection with multiple validation methods
  - Performance-optimized terminal initialization with proper addon loading order
  - WebGL context loss handling for production stability
  - Font size management with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+/-, Ctrl+0)
  - Advanced search functionality with overlay UI and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F)

- **Terminal Resizing Performance Fix**:
  - Fixed critical terminal resizing bug that prevented dynamic viewport adaptation
  - Implemented WebGL addon with proper context loss handling for hardware acceleration
  - Resolved resize event loop caused by multiple competing ResizeObserver instances
  - Fixed initialization timing by loading FitAddon before terminal opening
  - Removed CSS layout conflicts by eliminating `!important` declarations in `.xterm-screen`
  - Eliminated debouncing and cooldown periods for immediate resize response
  - Cleaned up all debug logging code for production-ready performance
  - Terminal now handles very small viewport sizes gracefully (like VS Code/Alacritty)
  - Achieved instant resize response with 5px threshold optimization

- **v0.2 Complete Backend Refactoring**:
  - Comprehensive 5-phase architectural transformation from v0.1 to v0.2
  - Interface-based architecture with dependency injection for better testability
  - Centralized configuration management (`internal/config/config.go`)
  - Structured logging system with component-specific loggers (`internal/logger/logger.go`)
  - Proper context propagation and graceful shutdown coordination
  - Comprehensive interface definitions (`internal/interfaces/interfaces.go`)
  - Factory patterns for testable component creation

- **Asset Reorganization**:
  - Created organized directory structure: `css/`, `js/`, and `icons/` subdirectories
  - Moved `terminal.css` to `cmd/portty/assets/css/terminal.css`
  - Moved `terminal.js` and `sw.js` to `cmd/portty/assets/js/` directory
  - Created theme-based icon system with `light-theme-icon.svg` and `dark-theme-icon.svg`
  - Updated all file references in `index.html`, `sw.js`, and `manifest.json`

  - Connection status indicators and info buttons
  - PWA installation prompts and native app experience
  - Offline caching strategy for app shell

- **Code Quality Improvements**:
  - Eliminated code duplications between CSS and JavaScript
  - Centralized configuration using CSS custom properties
  - Consolidated connection status management into single class
  - Standardized font to JetBrains Mono across entire application
  - Removed redundant files and references
  - Improved code maintainability and DRY principles
