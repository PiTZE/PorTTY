## Recent Work (Latest Updates)
- **Code Refactoring and UI Enhancements (Latest)**:
  - **Validation Simplification**: Removed unused context parameters from validation functions in main.go
  - **Font Configuration System**: Added comprehensive font management with API-driven configuration
  - **Ligatures Support**: Integrated xterm-addon-ligatures v0.9.0 for enhanced typography
  - **TOML Configuration**: Added BurntSushi/toml v1.4.0 dependency for structured configuration
  - **FontManager Class**: Implemented runtime font updates with document.fonts.ready synchronization
  - **WebGL Detection**: Replaced mobile device detection with proper WebGL2 support testing
  - **UI Cleanup**: Removed offline connection error modal and associated CSS styles
  - **Code Organization**: Improved CSS sections with clearer naming conventions

- **Build System Modernization (Previous)**:
  - **Directory Structure Update**: Changed build outputs from `build/` to `dist/` directories
  - **Output Organization**: Binaries in `dist/bin/`, release archives in `dist/release/`
  - **Code Style Compliance**: Applied minimal commenting philosophy to build.sh
  - **Removed Useless Comments**: Eliminated explanatory comments that restate code functionality
  - **Self-Documenting Code**: Maintained clear function names and logical organization
  - **Testing Verified**: All build modes working correctly with new directory structure

- **Project File Cleanup (Previous)**:
  - **Gitignore Modernization**: Updated to ignore `dist/` instead of `build/`
  - **Clean Project Structure**: Simplified ignore rules focusing on project essentials
  - **Professional Standards**: Applied coding style guide principles throughout

- **Build System Overhaul (Previous)**:
  - **Issue Identified**: Build script only created one binary and exited, no tar files generated for default builds
  - **Root Cause**: `set -e` combined with arithmetic operations `((build_count++))` causing script exit on first increment
  - **Solution Applied**: Changed arithmetic operations to `build_count=$((build_count + 1))` format
  - **Default Build Fix**: Removed version check preventing tar creation in dev mode - now all builds create tar files
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Successfully builds 13 platform combinations with static linking for universal compatibility
  - **Testing Verified**: All build modes (`./build.sh`, `./build.sh all`, `./build.sh release`) working correctly

- **Critical Installation Fix (Previous)**:
  - **Issue Identified**: Download failures with curl exit code 3 (URL malformed) due to temporary file creation problems
  - **Root Cause**: `mktemp` attempting to create files in `/usr/local/bin/` without proper permissions
  - **Solution Applied**: Changed temporary file creation to use system temp directory with `-t` flag
  - **Fix Verified**: Complete installation process now works correctly with successful download, extraction, and service startup
  - **Testing Confirmed**: Full installation cycle tested successfully with v0.2 release artifacts

- **Professional CLI Tools & Installation System**:
  - **Complete Feature Parity**: Interactive and command-line modes offer identical functionality (43/43 tests passing)
  - **Enhanced Install.sh Script**: Professional CLI with colored output, comprehensive error handling, and recovery suggestions
  - **Enhanced PorTTY Binary CLI**: Professional argument parsing with both short and long flag support
  - **Production-Ready Quality**: Enterprise-grade installer suitable for professional deployment
  - **Smart Privilege Handling**: Interactive mode entry without requiring root upfront
  - **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Port range checking, interface validation, directory verification
  - **Robust Download System**: Support for compressed GitHub release archives with proper extraction
  - **Code Style Compliance**: Applied minimal commenting philosophy with self-documenting code
